<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

<!-- WHAT -->
### What?
A broad analysis of socio-political and economic factors worldwide and their levels of correlation with global Happiness scores. This is a simple, fun and functional project designed to showcase data processing, tableau and presentation skills. 

<!-- WHY -->
### Why?

* Happiness may be predicted by looking at a handful of socio-political and economic statistics.
  
* These measurements can be used to develop a ‘recipe for happiness’ that governments can work towards, in order to ensure their citizens have the best possible quality of life.
  
* Obviously this is a naive viewpoint, as there are many other motivations driving governments besides the general happiness level of their residents; greed, power, religious motivations, throwing off the shackles of colonialism, the list goes on.
  
* However, for the purpose of this study, we’ll proceed under the delightful delusion that universal happiness is the goal!

<!-- HOW -->
### How?

For this investigation, 8 datasets were used:

1. Happiness Score
2. Countries & Continents
3. Average Daily Income
4. Income Inequality Index (Gini Coefficient)
5. Democracy Index
6. Functioning Government Index
7. Population
8. Average Percentage of Parliamentary Positions Occupied by Women

<!-- CONCLUSIONS -->
## Conclusions

* #### Low income inequality

Interestingly, from our data we can see that happiness depends less on how much money people earn in general, and more on how well- distributed this money is.

* #### High Average Daily Income

Countries with both a high Average Daily Income and low Income Inequality are (naturally) the happiest.

* #### Functioning Democratic Government

Happier countries have a well-run democracy at the helm.

* #### A sprinkling of Women in Parliament 

This indicates higher gender equality, which translates to more voices for representation, and therefore better levels of democracy.
